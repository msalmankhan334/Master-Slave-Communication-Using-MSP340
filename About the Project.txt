The Project is about to implement a system , based on MSP340 Microcontrollers.
What to learn from the Project:
1-	Master-Slave Communication (i.e MSP430_1 and MSP430_2)
2-	UART Communication and SPI Communication
3-	Analog to Digital Converter and Digital to Analog Converter.

Software Used for Simulation is: Proteus, Output and Sketch of the Project is Provided.

How to Run:
You can open the project directly in proteus software.
Start: Build/Run
Note: You should have to download MSP430 compiler, and set "PATH" in Proteus; tell the directly where is MSP430 compiler is.
in my case it is: c/msp430/bin, but yours may be different from Mine.
